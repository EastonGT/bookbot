# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Update April 28th:
So far in this topic it has allowed me to practice building a workspace environment on Linux, syncing to github using both CLI and VSCode, and refactoring code to multiple files. 
Another goal will be to work with this repository on another machine, as I can currently only work on it from home using my Linux Mint Virtual Box.
